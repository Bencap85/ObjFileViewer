A Simple 3D rendering engine for .obj files built with Python. It was fascinating to learn about all of the techniques that go into 3D rendering, including all of the matrix manipulation involved. This project uses PyGame for graphics rendering and control and NumPy for matrix operations.

Once the project is cloned and all dependancies are installed, execute 'python main.py <path_to_obj_file>' to view the file (an example file is provided: obj_files/t_34.obj.)
